I didn't find this too hard because I've used sqlite before (and the answers were all in the walkthough...). I do always find it interesting seeing how others who use it more
 frequently do things though as I often just go for the first answer I think of. For example in Q7 I first did:

SELECT AVG(energy)
FROM songs
WHERE artist_id =
(
    SELECT id
    FROM artists
    WHERE name = 'Drake'
);

However the answer in the walkthough was much more elegant:

SELECT AVG(energy)
FROM songs
JOIN artists ON songs.artist_id = artists.id
WHERE artists.name = 'Drake';

My reflection is that I should spend some more time thinking about a better solution rather than taking the easy route.
